# `shared-clock`

> `shared-clock` is an example application of the [`soundworks`](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks) framework.

This application presents the implementation of a simple clock running in a synchronized transport.

```
git clone https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks-shared-clock.git
cd soundworks-soundfield
npm install
npm run transpile
npm run start
```

Once the server is up and running you can access the clock locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` and the controller at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/controller`.

You can refer to the [`soundworks-template`](https://github.com/collective-soundworks/soundworks-template) repository to learn more about the structure of this project.
